                    Be silent always, when you doubt your sense;
                    And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence.
                    Some positive persisting fops we know,
                    Who, if once wrong will needs be always so;
                    But you, with pleasure, own your errors past,
                    And make each day a critique on the last.

                    But you who seek to give and merit fame,
                    And justly bear a critic's noble name.
                    Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,
                    How far your genius, taste, and learning go.
                    Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,
                    And mark that point where sense and dullness meet.
                    You then, whose judgment the right course would steer,
                    Know well each ancient's proper character.
                    His fable subject scope in every page,
                    religion, country, genius of his age.
                    Without all these at once before your eyes,
                    Cavil you may, but never criticise.
                    A little learning is a dangerous thing,
                    Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.
                    There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
                    And drinking largely sobers us again.
                    Tired at first sight with what the muse imparts,
                    In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts.

                        For Ravenclaw, the cleverest Would always be the best; For Hufflepuff, hard workers were Most worthy of admission;
                        And power-hungry Slytherin Loved those of great ambition. While still alive they did divide Their favorites from the throng,
                        Yet how to pick the worthy ones When they were dead and gone? ‘Twas Gryffindor who found the way, He whipped me off his head
                        The founders put some brains in me So I could choose instead! Now slip me snug about your ears,I’ve never yet been wrong,

                    Avoid extremes, and shun the fault of such,
                    Who still are pleased too little or too much.
                    At every trifle scorn to take offense,
                    That always shows great pride, or little sense.
                    Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best,
                    Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.
                    Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move,
                    For fools admire, but men of sense approve.
